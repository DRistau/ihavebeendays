IBeenDays
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kplaube/ibeendays.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kplaube/ibeendays)

IBeenDays (working title) is a web app that helps you tracking how many days you have doing (or not doing) something. I'm building this application in order to help me to control some manias, like nail biting or take too much coffee.


Why open source this?
---------------------------

Why not? Creating a basic API that solves this problem allow us to develop a lot of possibilities, like apps for wearables, browsers, smartphones, etc. If you are out of ideias in your Hackathon, use our API :)

This project is strongly inspired by [Toggl](http://toggl.com).
